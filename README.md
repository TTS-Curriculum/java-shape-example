# Java Shape Example

The contents of this file are for educational purposes.

In this file we include an interface called Shape. This interface declares a number of methods which must be implemented by its subclasses.

## Instructions

Download the repo using git or simply use the download link. Once you have the files on your local machine, you are free to use any Java IDE you choose or you can simply use the command line.

When using the command, you will need to use a terminal or putty (windows) to navigate to where you downloaded the project. Once there, use the commands below.

To compile all the java files on the command line use the following command:

```bash
> javac *.java
```

Then to run your newly compiled code type:

```bash
> java Triangle
```

or

```bash
> java Square
```

## Exercises

1. Remove area class from Triangle class and recompile.

   What happened and why?

2. Add a method to square to calculate the `circumference` of a square and ensure that it prints the circumference when ran. Method should take 1 argument

3. Create another method called `circumference` that takes two arguments, length and width and computes the circumference.

3. Convert the Shape class into an abstract class. Ensure it runs successfully.
