The contents of this file are for educational purposes.

In this file we include an interface called Shape. This interface declares a number of methods which must be implemented by its subclasses.

Exercises

1. Remove area class from Triangle class and recompile.

   What happened and why?

2. Add a method to square to calculate the `circumference` of a square and ensure that it prints the circumference when ran. Method should take 1 argument

3. Create another method called `circumference` that takes two arguments, length and width and computes the circumference.

3. Convert the Shape class into an abstract class. Ensure it runs successfully.
